## CLion settings

To avoid conflicts when developing using both Visual Studio Code and JetBrains CLion, use the following setting in the latter: `File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | CMake` > `Debug` > `Build directory`: `out\build\local`, and in turn, use the `VS Code Dev Container` profile preset in the former.
